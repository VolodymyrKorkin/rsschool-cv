### SAMPLE OF CODE
Create a Calculator constructor function that creates objects with three methods:
read() asks for two values ​​with prompt and stores their value in the properties of the object.
sum() returns the sum of the entered properties.
mul() returns the product of the input properties.
```javascript
function Calculator() {

  this.read = function() {
    this.firstNumber = +prompt('Введите первое число?', '0');
    this.secondNumber = +prompt('Введите второе число?', '0');	
  };

  this.sum = function() {
    return this.firstNumber + this.secondNumber;
  };

  this.mul = function() {
    return this.firstNumber * this.secondNumber;
  };
}

let calculator = new Calculator();
calculator.read();
